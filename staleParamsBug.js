In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that is conditionally rendered based on a route parameter can lead to unexpected behavior.  If the component isn't rendered initially because the route parameter is missing, and later appears, `useParams` might not update correctly, resulting in stale data or unexpected rendering. This is because `useParams` only updates when the URL changes. If the route parameter becomes available through an action other than a URL change (like state change), the component may not re-render with updated params.
